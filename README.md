## Description & inf. that map provides

This project was launched to provide anyone willing to know more about the geography of cinematograpy with sufficient information organised in a convinient way. If the user wants to know about movies made nearby, all he/she should do is to input the lantitude and longtitude of location he/she wants to get an iformation about (10 nearest places to it where at least one film was made and the list of films themselves). The application provides the user with geographic map (name.html file), which consists of three layers:

1. geographical map itself.

2. 10 colourful markers (the more reddish colour is, the higher density of film made on this therytory is) which when clicked on provides The user with information about films (title of film and its year, there are all the film from the oldenst to the newest sorted and enumerated).

3. colored map responding to contry's teritories colored from the lightest to the darkest colour (light colour represents contries with a few films made on their land and dark - countries with developed motion picture industry).

The best side of this project is that map is interctive, the user can zoom it in or out and move through the continents just moving mouse cursor. The data is visual and easy to understand intuitively, for example, coloring of markers and areas of continens. The information that map rovides user with can be used in different ways from making charts of most film-advanced nation to rating areas with the highest film density. In other words, all user need is to know the coordinates of the area he/she is intersted in and heve a browser to open a map.
